# Interactive maps with leaflet


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2023.

### Session contents

Join us for an engaging workshop session on the Leaflet package in R, where you'll dive into the world of interactive mapping and geospatial data visualization. Leaflet is a powerful and flexible open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps in web applications. In this session, you'll learn how to harness its capabilities within the R programming environment to create stunning, interactive maps for various purposes.

You can access our presentatition [here](add link to the presentation), and our exercise example [here](add link to exercise).

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the leaflet package and some of its applications for geospacial analysis, (2) show you  key functions and the basic steps to make an interactive map in R, and (3) provide you with practice exercise as well as some further material that can be useful for the topic of this workshop.
